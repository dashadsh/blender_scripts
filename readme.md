Some python scripts for Blender automation

Use Z values as primary musical element because:

They have more variation (standard deviation 0.9004 vs 0.3931 for X)
They show clear periodicity (approximately every 5 frames)
They have 884 peaks and 812 valleys, creating a complex but structured rhythm


Musical mapping ideas for Z values:

Map Z values to pitch (lower Z = lower pitch)
Use the detected periodicity (5 frames) to create rhythm patterns
The Z range (-5.31 to 0.65) could map well to about 6 octaves in musical scale


Use X values as secondary/complementary elements:

Map X values to stereo panning (left/right positioning)
Use X for modulation effects like vibrato or tremolo
Create counterpoint melodies with X that complement the Z-based melody


Combined approach:

Create a primary melody from Z values
Use X values for harmonization or countermelody
The ratio between X and Z variations (0.4366) suggests X could work well as a subtle modulation to Z-based sounds



For implementation, I could:

Normalize both datasets to musical ranges (e.g., MIDI notes 36-96)
Consider using a 33.33 RPM timing reference (matching your vinyl) for rhythm
Use the peaks/valleys to trigger percussion or accent notes

The periodic nature of your Z data (every 5 frames) suggests this would translate well to music with a clear rhythmic structure while maintaining organic variations from the vinyl surface.
